## Adding builds/files to my game page

Once your words and images have convinced someone to try your game, you have to give them something to play. If your game is far enough along in development that you have some sort of playable build (alpha, beta, prototype, etc.), go ahead and upload it. If your game's development status is "Complete" or "Canceled" then you are required to upload a build.

To add a game build or another file, go to your [developer dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/) and select a game from under "Your Games". You will be taken to the game's management page. Visit the "Builds & Files" tab and click "Add Package" to begin.

You will need to enter a title and a description for each package you create. After you create the package, you can then add builds and files.
