# How to Game Jolt: Developer's Guide

## Create a Developer Account

The first step is creating a developer account. If you're reading this, there's a good chance you already have a developer account on Game Jolt. If not, read on.

If you don't have a Game Jolt account at all, go ahead and [sign up](http://gamejolt.com/auth/sign_up/) for one.   

If you already have a gamer account on Game Jolt, it's a cinch to become a developer. Just hover your mouse over "Dashboard" (on the navigation bar at the top of the page) until a new menu appears, then click/tap "Become a Developer".

### Your Avatar

If you haven't already, be sure to change your avatar to something other than the default one (even though it's pretty cute). It's a simple thing to do and it makes you stand out from the crowd wherever your avatar appears (on your game pages, beside comments you make, etc.)

Game Jolt uses Gravatar for avatars. Sign up for an account at [gravatar.com](http://gravatar.com/) using the same email address you use for Game Jolt and upload your avatar image. It will automatically begin appearing throughout the site. If you already use Gravatar, you've probably already seen your avatar on the site. If you want it to be something else, upload a new image to Gravatar and associate it with the email address you use for Game Jolt.

### Your Profile

Take some time to fill out your profile. This is a chance to tell people a little about yourself and your goals as a developer. Maybe talk a bit about what kinds of games interest you, if you're looking for collaborators, if you're into game jams, and that kind of thing. If you have a Patreon page or other personal websites, feel free to put links here. 

Speaking of links, linking your social media accounts with Game Jolt is more important than you might think. Don't put your Twitter and Facebook links in the body of your profile; [link them](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/linked-accounts/) directly. They will appear big and bold on the side of your profile, which makes it easier for fans, press, staff, etc. to contact you.

## Add a Game

Dev account all set up? Good. Now you're ready to start adding your games to the site.

#### What kind of games can be uploaded?

Game Jolt is currently focused exclusively on free indie games. These can be hobbyist creations, labors of love, early prototypes, jam games, student projects, fan games, experiments, art games, alt games, or of any other origin--as long as they are free.

They can be open source, Creative Commons licensed, or all rights reserved; they just have to be uploaded by their developer and they have to be free. Publishers cannot upload games; only developers. 

#### Adding a Game

Go ahead and hit "Dashboard" on the black nav bar. Welcome to your developer dashboard! This is where you can access any games you have added. Now hit the big "Add a Game" button. Go ahead, do it.

### The Rules

The first thing you'll see are the rules for adding a game to Game Jolt. The rules are there for a reason. You have to agree to them before you add a game, and if your game breaks the rules, it will be removed. Read the rules and abide by them. That way everyone stays happy and nobody gets hurt. That last bit was a joke. Someone always gets hurt. Just kidding. The rules are serious, though.

### Game Information

You'll need to fill in some basic information about your game in order to proceed.

**Title:** Surely your game has a name. Put it here.

- _A note on mature language:_ If your game's title contains the "F-word" or a swear word of that magnitude, please replace one or more of its letters with *. This will keep browsing friendly for people who do not wish to view mature content. This only applies to titles and thumbnails because they show up in lists and search results; once someone visits a game page, there is a maturity rating on display and one can make their own decision about whether to read the description and play the game. 

**Website:** If you wish to link to a personal website about the game or about your games in general, this is the place to do it.

**Category:** You have to choose a category for your game. The category you pick is entirely up to you. Categories are meant to be helpful, not restrictive. They are signposts to aid gamers in browsing the site and finding the games they want to play. You might want to browse the category listings yourself to see what kinds of games have been assigned to them in the past. You can find all of the categories atop the Game Jolt homepage under "Browse Games by Category". Aren't the icons adorable?

**Development Status:** You must indicate your game's development status. You can choose one of three options:

- **Finished:** Your game is complete. You're uploading a build, and that build is stable. You might upload fixes or other small updates, but you don't expect to make any major changes. 
- **Work-in-Progress:** Your game is still in development. You might have an alpha/beta/test build for people to play, but it may be unstable. Major updates are planned. 
- **Canceled:** Your game is not what you'd consider complete, but you've ceased development on it. There is a playable build (stable or not), but you don't plan to ever update the game. 

**Engine/Language:** It's helpful for us and for other developers to know what engine, language, or game creation tool was used to make a game. Select the one you used from the massive list. If you select "Other", please type in which one you used. 

**Description:** This is super important, which is why you have to write something here now. Don't worry; your game page will remain hidden until you are ready to publish it, so your description doesn't have to be final yet. You can start with a rough description and then hone it and add to it progressively. 

Spend some time on your game description before you publish. This is your chance to tell prospective players why they should spend their time playing your game.

Here are some things you could put in your game description:

- **Elevator pitch:** In just a sentence or two, deliver a hook. What makes your game unique and interesting? 
- **Story overview:** Tell us a little about the game's plot and characters. For example: Who do we control? Why are we doing what we're doing? Who or what's trying to stop us? Where is it all taking place? 
- **Gameplay summary:** Describe how your game plays. Is it like a mix of these two cool games, with a twist of this other one? Is it something completely unheard of? How would you describe it? 
- **Development background:** You could let people know a little about the origin of the game and how long it took to make. Was it the product of a jam? Was it a school project? What was your inspiration? What was your objective in making this game? 
- **Instructions/controls:** How does one play the game? What keys do we press? Is a controller recommended? Is it compatible with peripherals like Oculus Rift or Leap Motion? 
- **Credits/thanks:** Even if you've already done so in the game, you can go ahead and give credit here to collaborators, musicians, and anyone else to whom credit is due. If you like, you can give special thanks to anyone who may have helped or inspired you, as well. 
- **Request feedback:** If you're looking for some good feedback, encourage people to leave some in the comments. It's assumed that you want feedback simply by virtue of having posted your game on the site, but it can help to let players know that you're really interested in comments and willing to update the game based on them.  
- **Plans:** If the game is a work-in-progress, explain your vision for the final version. Do you have a development roadmap or a target date for completion? How often do you think you will work on the project? Be sure to encourage visitors to follow your game so they can be notified of news updates. 
- **History:** If you've made updates to your game, you can put a quick summary of them here. If you have multiple builds, you can let people know what to expect in each one, and which one is the latest. 

### Add Game

Once you hit that button, your game page will be created. However, the page starts out hidden and only those with the link can view it. As long as it's hidden, it will not show up in search results nor appear in the Newly Added section. Your game is not considered "published" until you unhide it.

## Manage Your Game

Here's where you'll manage and edit every aspect of your game.

### Game Information

If you want to make any changes to anything you've already entered, such as the game title or description, you can do so via "Game Information" on the Overview.

### Header

Don't game pages with headers look just splendid? Headers are the big, banner-like images that adorn the tops of game pages. They are optional but highly, highly recommended.  

You might want to experiment with different images to see what looks good as a header. Screenshots often turn out well, but some of the nicest looking headers are created for the purpose. For more tips, see the section "Choosing a Thumbnail"; most of it applies to headers, too. 

For your header to look its best on mobile devices in portrait mode, make sure anything important is located near the center of the image.

#### Header Specifications

Here are the requirements and recommendations for headers:

- The image format can be PNG, JPG, or GIF.  PNG is recommended! 

- In general, your image should be as large as possible. In addition: 
    - The minimum recommended width is 1920. The absolute minimum width is 950. 
    - The maximum width is 5120. 

- The height of your image should be from 15% to 35% of its width. 
    - **Tip:** To find an acceptable width, take the height and multiply it by 150 to 350.

**Making a Quick and Dirty Header**

If you don't want to make a custom image for your header, use a screenshot. A lot of screenshots turn out really nicely when blown up to header size.  

When taking your screenshot, run the game full-screen or in the highest resolution it supports. Make sure to capture the image as a PNG.  

If the image is already 2000 pixels wide or wider, it is ready to upload. If it is skinnier than 2000, use some imaging software to resize it to 2000 pixels wide (don't resize it by percentage). Make sure to preserve the aspect ratio. Don't resample the image and don't sharpen it.  

Upload it and see what you've got. It probably looks pretty good. If it's not quite to your liking, you can go back and try enlarging the image further, or try starting out with a different shot, or try cropping the original image to rearrange the layout before you enlarge it.

### Thumbnail

Your game's thumbnail is probably the most important image of your game on the site. This is the image that will appear on the Newly Added list, in search results, and so on.  

It's hard to stress the importance of thumbnails enough. These little images can be the difference between someone checking out your game and barely noticing it. In many cases, a thumbnail will be the first impression someone has of your game.

#### Choosing a Thumbnail

Think of your game's thumbnail as its box cover if it was sold off a shelf in a store (they used to do that, you know). It should attract attention and give an impression of what the game is like. 

A good thumbnail should be more than just a title floating on a blank background. Many good thumbnails are simply well-framed screenshots with the game's title added. Other good ones are images created specifically for the thumbnail using art from the game.

Don't stress too much about getting your image to the correct size; there's a handy cropper tool to make it easy for you. But you should still start out with a high-quality original image (see the recommendations below, under "Thumbnail Specifications").

Only use images that you created. Don't use another game's image, an internet meme, something you found on Deviantart, or anything like that.

A note on mature content: Please don't choose an image for your thumbnail that contains nudity, swear words, or adult-oriented imagery. This only applies to thumbnails, not to other images, because they show up on public lists and in search results; once someone visits a game page, there is a maturity rating on display and one can make their own decision about whether to stay on the page and play the game.

#### Thumbnail Specifications

Here are the technical requirements, and some recommendations, for thumbnails:

**Image Requirements and Recommendations**

- Your original image should be as large as possible (up to 4096x4096). 

- The minimum dimensions are 640x360 (recommended minimum of 1280x720 to look decent on 4K displays). 

- The maximum width and height are each 4096. 

- The aspect ratio must be 16x9. If your image is not 16x9, you can use the handy cropping tool that we've provided. Alternatively, you can crop it with your tool of choice before uploading. 

    - Tip: This will help if you're not using our cropping tool. You can find the necessary height by taking the image's current width and multiplying it by 0.5625. Round up. 

- The maximum file size is 3MB. If your file is larger, try compressing and/or optimizing the image. 

- Your file must be a PNG, JPG, GIF, or animated GIF. PNGs generally look the best and are recommended. 

### Maturity Rating

Before you unhide your game and show it to the world, you have to give it a maturity rating. We don't mind having games with mature content on the site as long as they are rated appropriately. 

Take a few moments to go through the list and mark anything that applies to your game. Once you've done that, consider if your maturity rating is still appropriate. When you're satisfied that your selection is an accurate reflection of the game's content, go ahead and set the maturity rating. And remember, you can come back and make changes at any time.

### Unhide Your Game?

This is it, the big moment. Once your game has a thumbnail and a maturity rating, you will be able to unleash it upon an unsuspecting public.

But WAIT! Before you unhide your game, you can add media, music, news, and actual game builds to make your game page all that it can be.

### Media

Screenshots and videos are the two types of media that you can add to your game page (not counting music, which gets its own section). Media is vital to getting your game page into a presentable state for the public. A game page without any media just looks unfinished. A well-rounded game page has plenty of images--moving and still.

#### Screenshots

There's a distinct possibility that screenshots are the single most vital element of your game pages, in terms of catching the attention of people who have already been enticed by your thumbnail, or who are visiting via a direct link to your game page. Many people will simply skip over a downloadable game with no screenshots.

Even if your game is played in-browser, your game page should have some screenshots on it. A prospective player's interest might wane more quickly than the game loads, but a picture could capture their attention. And who knows, we might change the way browser games are served up in the future, so screenshots might become a gamer's only visual cue to the game's content.

If your game is a work-in-progress, it's essential to post screenshots in order to get--and keep--people interested in your game. Screenshots are excellent proof of development for anyone interested in following along with your progress.

Screenshots can even keep people who have already played your game coming back for more, having perhaps seen things in the images that they haven't yet seen in the game.

One more thing about screenshots: You can actually upload images that aren't screenshots, too. But only post images that are relevant and your original work. Say you built your game's graphics out of clay; a photo of the models might make a cool "screenshot". Or maybe you built a custom arcade cabinet for your game; a picture of that would be perfect. Made some mockup box art? That 

Screenshots can be any size and a few different formats, but a here are a couple general rules of thumb:

1. The bigger the image, the better the quality. 
2. In most cases, a PNG file is the way to go. 

#### Video

The moving image is an incredibly effective medium. Humans just love it. So spruce up your game page with some video! Adding a video is as simple as entering a link to Youtube or Vimeo and giving it a title and, optionally, a description.

You can add videos that you recorded or ones that other people made about your game. Here are some ideas for what kinds of videos you can add:

- Game trailers 
- Gameplay footage 
- Development timelapse 
- Dev diaries 
- Let's plays 
- Video reviews 

Note that if your game is a work-in-progress and you haven't posted a build, videos are probably the best way of showing off the progress of your development.

### Music

Music is another thing that humans love. If someone likes your game's music, they might want to download it. So why not make it easy for them? To add a song to your game page, just upload an MP3 and give it a title.

There is also a little thing called [Game Jolt Radio](http://gamejolt.fm/) that streams random tracks from the site. Uploading songs gets your game's music added to the pool. 

### Builds/Files

Once your words and images have convinced someone to try your game, you have to give them something to play. If your game is far enough along in development that you have some sort of playable build (alpha, beta, prototype, etc.), go ahead and upload it. If your game's development status is "Complete" or "Canceled" then you are required to upload a build.

You will need to enter a title and a description for each build you upload.

#### Unhiding Builds

If you are ready for people to play your game, remember to unhide the build(s).

When you upload a build, it will be hidden by default. Even if your game page is unhidden, you will need to unhide your build in order for it to show up on the page.

### Build Types

Game Jolt supports both downloadable games and browser-based games.

#### Downloadable/Desktop

If your game is downloadable, you should generally compress your game files into a single .zip file and upload that (unless your build consists of a single file). Whether you've got an installer, a stand-alone application, a complex system of folders, or anything in between, zip it all up. When you upload the build, choose the platform/operating system on which it runs (Windows, Linux, Mac, or Other).

If you're adding a downloadable build, here's something to keep in mind: The more steps a gamer has to go through in order to play your game, the less likely they are to actually play it. 

For example: If you made your game in LOVE or Pygame, compile an executable build rather than expecting players to already have downloaded and installed what they need to run it. If you made your game in RPG Maker, don't expect everyone to go through the extra work of installing a runtime package or a new font.

#### Browser/Web

If your game runs in a browser, with or without a plugin, the type of file you upload depends on the kind of build you have. The most popular types of browser builds on the site are HTML, Unity, and Flash, although you can also upload Java applets and Silverlight applications (if you must). When you upload your browser build, you will be asked to specify type of build, as well as the game's width and height in pixels.

#### What files do I upload?

It depends on what kind of build you have...

HTML: HTML games can be played in any modern browser without any plugins, and they can be enjoyed on many mobile devices. If you're adding an HTML build, upload a .zip file containing the index.html file and all the files and assets necessary to run the game.

Unity: If your Unity build is meant to be downloaded, you should upload a .zip file containing an application file and a data folder. If you're adding a browser build meant to be played using the Unity Webplayer plugin, you should upload a single .unity3d file. You may also want to disable right click behaviour by ticking the checkbox.

Flash: If you are adding a game to be played in browsers equipped with the Adobe Flash Player plugin, upload a single .swf file.

Java: You can upload a Java applet as a downloadable file and you can also upload it as a browser build. Either way, you can upload a single .jar file. For a web build, you'll need to specify the main Java class name.

Silverlight: Silverlight was essentially Microsoft's answer to Adobe's Flash, only it never really caught on and now it's been deprecated by the company. Game Jolt doesn't want to stop supporting any old games on the site, so you can technically still upload Silverlight games. You'll need to upload a .xap file, which is just a renamed .zip file that contains an "AppManifest.xaml" file and any DLL files required by the application. 

#### Can I upload Android games?

Sure! We haven't officially added Android as an operating system yet, but you can just upload a .apk file as "Other". Be sure to let people know it's an Android build in the file description.

#### How big can my game be?

It can take as many hours to complete and be as ambitious in scope as you want, though we recommend starting out much smaller. Oh, you're probably asking about the maximum file size. In that case, you have a limit of 1,000MB (that's 1GB) per build. If your game is larger than that, try compressing audio, video, and textures. 

#### Quick Play

Quick Play is a way for gamers to play a downloadable build without actually downloading and extracting the files. It's a good way for someone to preview a game. Only games with a .exe. file work with Quick Play. After you've added a downloadable build, you will be able to set it up.

Tap or click "Setup Quick Play". You can enable Quick Play by simply ticking the box. If you uploaded a single .exe file, no further action is required. If the executable file is within a .zip file, you must specify the filename and path. 

### Supplemental and Other Files

These are completely unnecessary, but frequently awesome, and they really show that the developer has gone that extra mile. You can upload any kind of zipped files you want as "Other" builds, like manuals, maps, charts, comics, Infocom-style feelies, a print-and-play adaptation, or anything else you can think of that's not a game or music file.

### API: Score Tables, Trophies, and More

Implementing the Game API will allow you to not only create leaderboards and trophies, but also sign players in automatically, store data online, and log game sessions. If you have added the Game API to your game, you can create score tables and trophies (and view globally stored data) here. 

Members of the Game Jolt community have written various libraries and plugins that make implementing the API fairly easy on most platforms. Consult the [overview of the Game API](http://gamejolt.com/developers/achievements-new/) for more information and links to the currently supported engines and languages. If you want to write something yourself, here is the [documentation](http://gamejolt.com/api/doc/game). We welcome any contributions that make the API easier to use or more accessible!

### News

From your game's management page, you can create news updates to post about your game. News updates trigger follower notifications and are an essential part of publicizing your game.

---

### Publicizing Your Game

Once you've published your game and it shows up in New Releases, you can expect a few people to stumble across it and play it. But you shouldn't just wait around and hope your game happens to go viral. If you want more plays, you're going to have to publicize it. Here's how:

**News Updates:** News posts are a great way to garner your game some new or renewed attention and they are the primary means of staying in contact with your game's followers. Post news updates whenever anything interesting happens with your game. Followers will be sent notifications and the news will be archived on your game page. 

If you upload a new build of your game, you should take the time to make a news update. If your game just won a jam or an award, make a news update about it. If someone posted a new Let's Play, or if someone in the press wrote a review, go ahead and make a news update.

**Social Media:** Tweet the link every day. Post it on Facebook. Write about it on Tumblr. Do whatever it is you do on Google+ and any other social network in which you're involved. Oh, and if you're not on any social networks, you really should at least get a Twitter account. Twitter is a goldmine of indie game development news and networking and a great tool for publicizing games. 

**Rate and Comment:** You should play, rate, and comment on other people's games. This can encourage them to check out your games. It also spreads your name around. If people keep seeing your avatar on games they like, they might get curious and check out your profile.

**Email Press:** Seek press coverage by emailing blogs and indie game news sites. Email a lot of them. Don't be shy; the worst thing they can do is ignore you. Expect to receive little if any response, but all the effort becomes worth it when you see your game recommended online.

**Contact Let's Players:** Youtube and Twitch broadcasters have become hugely important tastemakers and sources of publicity. And they want games to play! Find some that play games like yours and email them.

### How to Get Followers

It's pretty easy to get people to follow your game, really. It's all right here in this guide. To get people interested in your game, give it a nice thumbnail, a decent description, a good-looking header, and plenty of screenshots. Post some videos and some music. Make news posts, but not so often that they become spam. Reply to comments on your game pages.

Don't announce that you'll post a build when you get X number of followers; instead, give potential followers some evidence that you're making progress on your game. Don't be secretive and assume people will be excited about your game because you are; use your game page to show why being a follower is worth their time and inbox space.

### Keeping in Touch

Stay in contact with other developers and with the people who play your game; they are the best sources of thoughtful feedback. Furthermore, they are frequent transmitters of word-of-mouth publicity.

When people leave comments on your game, reply to them! Players who take the time to comment are more likely to do so in the future if they know they have been heard. Use replies to give thanks for praise, address criticism, and evaluate suggestions. Comments and replies can become a dialogue that results in a better game.  

Did you know you have a blog? Well you do, and it's accessible from your dashboard. Your developer blog is an excellent tool to keep fans and followers engaged, and to convert new ones. Post about gaming, game dev, or life in general; it's your blog. Remember that if you're posting news about a specific game, go to the management panel for that game and make a news post.

### Ad Revenue

Game Jolt shares ad revenue with developers. You get 30% of the revenue generated by any ads on your game pages and blog pages. The actual amount per ad impression varies from day to day as we work to place the best, most lucrative ads on the site. 

Revenue is calculated daily and automatically accrues. Reporting generally lags a day or two behind real time. You can withdraw any amount in your account at any time by transferring the funds to a Paypal account. To set this up, simply enter your Paypal email address [here](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/developer/withdraw-funds/). Your revenue information is displayed on your developer dashboard.

### Making Games

How do you make a game, you ask? First, you have to have the passion burning inside you. You have to want to eat, drink, sleep, and bathe in indie games... Nah, just kidding. We can't teach you how to make games (not until Game Jolt University is established), but it's pretty easy to teach yourself how to do it. A lot of indie game developers taught themselves how to do things like designing, coding, making graphics, and creating sounds.

What we can do is point you in the direction of a couple of excellent resources that will get you started. If you're an absolute beginner, or even if you've already started making games but could use some further instruction, either of the following sites is a great jumping-off point:
