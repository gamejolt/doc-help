## Where is the private key for my game?

When you implement the Game API, you will need to know your game's private key. To find it, go to your [developer dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/) and select the game from under "Your Games". Choose the "Game API" tab, then select "API Settings" on the left. Click "Show Key" to display it. You can copy it to your clipboard for easy pasting.

If you ever want to change your private key, you can click "Generate New Key". Note that if you generate a new key for your game, you will need to update the API code in your game with the new key.
