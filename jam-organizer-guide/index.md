# Game Jolt Jams, the Manual

## A Guide for Jam Organizers of All Experience Levels

Ready to run a game jam? Good, you've come to the right place. 

This guide will walk you through every aspect of using Game Jolt Jams and making the most out of the features at your disposal. We'll cover the how-to's, the why's, and the what-if's.

For ease of digestion, the information has been split into two sections, both equally important halves of the jam organizer's job: the planning and the execution. Let's dive in!

## Part 1 - Planning a Successful Game Jam

### What's a Game Jam, Anyway?

A game jam is an event in which participants gather (online or physically) to make games in a certain period of time. A lot of jams are built around a particular theme. Some jams are competitive and some are just for fun. 

Think of a group of musicians jamming away. They follow a certain structure and theme, but within those constraints, they create something original and new on the spot. That's a lot like what game jammers do. 

Game jams are a venerable tradition in the world of indie gaming. The first documented game jam, dubbed The 0th Annual Indie Game Jam, took place over the course of 4 days in 2002 and resulted in a dozen new games (you can read more about it [here](http://www.indiegamejam.com/igj0/)). It set the precedent for all game jams to follow.

Though there are many variations and permutations, all game jams share the following basic characteristics:

**Time Constraints:** Game jams are all about rapid game development over a short period of time. They are about focused bursts of creativity and experimentation. A lot of game jams take place over 48 hours, but there have been jams that lasted an hour and others that lasted a month.

**Creative Constraints:** Participants in the first game jam had to use a pre-made engine to make their games. In subsequent years, it became popular to assign a theme to a game jam. The purpose of a theme is to give developers a jumping-off point and to foster creativity. There may be further constraints or creative or technical challenges involved, as well.

**Location Constraints:** Many a jam takes place in a single physical location. The Global Game Jam happens in a bunch of different physical locations simultaneously. But most game jams these days, such as Ludum Dare, occur exclusively online, coordinated through a single website. Game Jolt Jams supports physical locations as well as online-only jamming. (So, perhaps this paragraph could be more accurately titled "Location Restraints or Lack Thereof"!)

### Some Considerations Before You Begin

An important part of organizing a game jam is the planning phase. There are several things you should decide upon before you start clicking and typing.

**Don't Go Alone (Unless You Want to):** You don't have to do it all by yourself. The Jams system allows you to add organizers with varying levels of access, so recruit some folks to lend you a hand. 

**Choosing Dates:** One of the biggest considerations for potential participants in your jam is timing. The calendar is full of jams and other events, so you don't want to get lost in the shuffle. Schedule your jam around events that will occupy the attention of a large chunk of indie developers, like big jams (Ludum Dare, Global Game Jam, etc.), conventions (GDC, Indiecade, PAX, etc.), holidays, popular sporting events, and so on.

**Is It a Competition?** Some jams are competitive and some are not. If your jam is strictly "for fun" and no "winners" will be declared, there will generally be a more laid-back atmosphere and a lot less work for you. If you're organizing a competition, you need to consider factors like judging, prizes, and cheating.

**Judges or Jury?** If it's a competition, how will the winners be picked? Game Jolt Jams allows you to choose whether to enable voting. If you don't enable voting, you can judge the entries yourself, or you can select a jury to choose the winner(s). If you use a jury, it's up to you to coordinate their efforts. If you decide on voting, you can choose to allow anyone with a Game Jolt account to judge games, or you can restrict voting to jam participants. Your choice of open or participant-only voting can determine a lot of the character of the jam. With open voting, you'll get more of a "people's choice" and there is a slight danger that it could devolve into a popularity contest (especially if there is an awesome prize--see below). If judging is left to participants, you're sure to get some well-informed votes, but remember that it will only be developers judging each other's work, and a more gamer-centric viewpoint may be lacking in the results.   

**Prizes?** If your jam has a winner or winners, do they get prizes? Some very successful jams have been competitions in which the only prize was glory and potential publicity. The obvious advantage of offering a prize of monetary value is that it will encourage people to participate. A potential disadvantage is that it will encourage some to cheat, especially if the prize is really spectacular. If there is a prize, expect the rules of the jam to be closely scrutinized, so you'll have to spend time making them as clear as possible and possibly answering questions about them (we'll discuss rules considerations below). Community judging can be problematic as well, when a prize is on offer. We've seen participants manipulate the system by getting groups of people to sign up and vote who wouldn't normally do so, such as YouTube followers, extended family, entire classrooms, etc. We've even seen the promise of future Steam codes given in exchange for votes. So if you do offer a prize of some value, you may want to consider judging the competition yourself, or using a jury. Regardless of how you choose the recipients, you will need to arrange for the prizes to be delivered to them (digitally or by snail mail, depending on the prize).

**Sponsors?** Some jams have companies as "sponsors" or "partners", but that's not at all necessary. However, if you can offer participants, say, a trial key for a popular game development software package in exchange for sticking a logo and a link on your jam page, you could very well see an uptick in participation. The downside is that you would have to deal with answering a potential flood of inquiries and then distributing the keys. But dealing with the logistics could be worth it. To get a sponsorship going, all you have to do is email the company with your proposal; we've found them to be generally amenable.

**A Keynote?** A keynote address is traditional for some recurring jams and a possibility for any jam. Keynote addresses generally introduce the jam, set the tone, discuss the theme, and/or deliver general advice and encouragement. If you can get someone to record a video of themselves making a little speech, it can be easily embedded on your jam homepage.

**Theme:** Most--but not all--game jams have a theme. In many cases, the theme is not announced until the very beginning of the jam. This keeps participants on their toes and cuts down on games being planned before the jam starts. Some hold to the erroneous view that waiting to reveal the theme cuts down on cheaters by enforcing the timeframe, but if someone is willing to cheat, they can easily shoehorn the theme into a game that's already in development. The real reason for having a theme is that creative constraints are good for making art. Have you ever been handed a blank page and told to write about anything you want? The scope can be intimidating. But given a blank page and a topic, you can easily start brainstorming.   

**Rules:** Your jam can have as many or as few rules as you wish to give it. By nature, a competitive jam needs more, stricter rules. In any case, you should consider some possibilities:

- Does the jam deadline have a grace period? Will you accept late entries (which is easily done) and under what circumstances? 
- If there is a voting or judging period, can participants update or add content to their games during it? Are bug fixes allowed? 
- Do games need to be made entirely within the timeframe of the jam? Can any pre-existing tools, art, music, and code be used? 
- Are teams allowed? Is there a limit to team size? 
- Do games have to adhere to the theme or is it really just a suggestion? 
- Are games required to be made with a certain tool, language, or engine? Are there any technical specifications which must be observed? 
- Do games have to be playable on a certain platform? For example, does there have to be a browser build, or a Windows download?  
- Is there a size limit on game files? (Game Jolt's upload limit is 1,000 MB per file.) 
- Must games be made exclusively for this jam? Are people allowed to submit the game to other jams simultaneously? 
- Are multiple submissions from one participant accepted? If someone submits  more than one game, are they all eligible to win the competition (if there is one)? 
- Are there any restrictions on content? Do you want to keep games appropriate for all ages or is any maturity level acceptable? You might also want to take the opportunity to discourage games that contain hate speech or other such content. 
- Some people are concerned with intellectual property rights, so you may want to state that all rights will be reserved by the developers and any games they submit will remain their property. 
 
**Publicity:** Game Jolt Jams is not Field of Dreams. If you build it, they will not necessarily come. It is your job to spread the word. You can publicize the jam using Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, the Game Jolt forums, other forums, and even by emailing the press. Shout it from the rooftops!

## Part 2 - Organizing a Game Jam, Step-by-Step

Here's what to do and how to do it. Let me hold your hand.

### Make a Game Jolt Account

The only things you need to get started with Game Jolt Jams is the will and a Game Jolt account. If you don't already have an account, go ahead and [sign up](http://gamejolt.com/auth/sign_up/) for one.

### Create a Jam

- **Starting Out:** Log into your Game Jolt account and point your browser at [jams.gamejolt.com](http://jams.gamejolt.com/), then click the big "CREATE A JAM NOW!" button. 
- **Creating a Jam:** Welcome to the "Create a Jam" page. It's time to fill out this form with the essential facts about your jam. But don't worry; your jam starts out hidden by default and you can change any of the information on this page at any time before you make the jam visible. 
- **Jam Name:** Your jam needs a name. You can include numbers if your jam is recurring. 
- **Custom URL:** After you make your jam visible, this is the URL people will use to visit the homepage. It's best to make the URL similar to the name of the jam; it will be easier for people to remember. Your URL will be something like "jams.gamejolt.io/yourjam". 
- **Jam Hashtag:** Jam participants will enter games into the jam by uploading them to Game Jolt and putting this hashtag in the game's description. It is important to distinguish the Jam Hashtag from the jam's Twitter hashtag. The Jam Hashtag is required, while a Twitter hashtag is optional (though recommended). To avoid confusion, it's a good idea to make your Jam Hashtag and your Twitter hashtag the same thing. Also, the hashtags should reflect the name of the jam. If the jam name is long, you may want to use an abbreviation. 
- **Twitter Hashtag:** A Twitter hashtag is optional but it's a really good idea, especially if you want your jam to have a healthy activity feed. If people tweet using the jam's Twitter hashtag, those tweets will show up in the jam's activity feed. Twitter is a fantastic resource for indie developers and a great way to spread the word about game jams. If you're an indie dev and you're not on Twitter, you should really consider joining the flock. 
- **Description:** This should be a brief summary of what your jam's all about. You don't need to go into much detail here. This description will appear in the active jam listings under the jam's name, so just provide enough information to pique the interest of someone browsing the listings. 
- **Analytics:** This is entirely optional, but you might be interested in tracking some stats about your jam pages' traffic. If so, you can integrate with Google Analytics by simply entering your Tracking ID. Here's how to get yours: 
    - If you don't have a Google Analytics account, create one. If you have one, log in: http://www.google.com/analytics/ 
    - Create a new Property. 
    - Enter "http://jams.gamejolt.io/" for the homepage. Enter other required information. 
    - Click "Get Tracking ID" 
- **Timezone:** This one's easy. Just select the timezone that you want the jam's clock to use. Your current timezone should be autodetected and selected by default. 
- **Start Date and Time:** Remember to choose the dates of your jam carefully, as discussed in Part 1. But it's okay if the dates are tentative at this point; they can still be changed. The start date can be adjusted any time before the jam actually starts.  
- **End Date and Time:** Your can schedule the end of the jam for any time after the jam starts. If you need to, you can extend the deadline. Even if the jam is already in progress, the end date can be changed up until the moment the jam ends. 
    - *A Note on Midnights:* Be careful when you schedule a start or end date for 12:00 AM. A jam that ends at, for example, midnight on the 9th of the month, ends as soon as the clock ticks over from the 8th to the 9th--not at the end of the day on the 9th. 
- **Create Jam:** Go ahead, click it. Remember, your jam will still remain hidden. 
  
### Jam Overview

Welcome to the Jam Overview. If you click the Manage Jam link, you'll arrive here. Now that you've created a jam, you'll be editing and managing it from the Jam Overview page. Let's go over the tools available to you. 

- Make Visible: Don't do this yet. But when you're ready, click this button to un-hide your jam and make it appear in the public listing. You also have the option of making your jam unlisted (visible to anyone with the link but not publicly listed), so be sure to check your visibility settings before you click here. 
- Customize Theme: This is the visual theme of your jam's webpages, not the jam's creative theme. If you've done any theme customizing with Tumblr, this should be pretty familiar to you. Use the dropdown menu to select which element of the jam pages to customize. 

- Header: The header will appear splashed across the top of every jam page. A header's text usually consists of the jam's name as a heading and perhaps a slogan or catchphrase for the body. You can control the appearance of any text in the header in the same way as you do the content (as described below). But most importantly, you can set up a background image for your header that will appear behind the text. It's hard to overstress the importance of using an image in your header. Sure, a customized, image-less jam page looks swell, but we estimate that using an image in the header increases jam participation by an average of one millionfold (this number may not be accurate, but hopefully the point is taken). The image should capture the essence of your jam, so that potential participants get a feel for your jam with a mere glance at the header image. Just be sure you have appropriate permission for any images that you use. 
    - How to Add a Header Image: Once you've chosen your image, you need to upload it somewhere online, such as an image host. Then simply enter the image's URL in the field provided. You may need to toy around with your image's size and proportions to get it looking exactly how you want it to. In general, the bigger the width and resolutio n, the better. Here, you are also able to tile the image and set its alignment. 

- Content: The content is the main section of text on your jam pages. By using the drop down menus and color pickers here, you can change the text's color and font to your liking. You can assign different colors and fonts to headings (h1, h2, etc.) and to links. You can even make links turn yet another color when a mouse cursor is hovered over them. Finally, you can choose a background color and, should you desire, a background image. If you do add a background image to the content, be sure that it doesn't make the text overlaying it hard to read.  
- Nav: This is the navigation bar that sits underneath the header and above the content. You can choose the bar's background color, as well as the color and font of the links on it. You can also set the colors of the active tab (for example, "Home" if you're on the homepage), and you can make those colors change upon hovering. 
- Countdown Timer: Lastly, we come to the countdown timer that appears on the jam's header. Your choice here is rather cut and dried. You can give the countdown timer a dark or light theme color. Which one you choose should depend on which one looks better against the header image. 
- Save Theme: Remember to save your work after you're done tinkering by clicking the Save Theme button. 

### Edit Jam

This tab contains most of the information you entered when you were creating the jam. There is also a new, extremely important setting that was not present on the Create a Jam page: the jam's visibility.

- **Editing:** You can edit the jam's name, hashtags, description, and tracking ID at any time, though you should probably avoid it once the jam has begun. The start date/time can be altered any time before the jam begins, and the end date/time can be changed any time before it actually ends. 
- **Setting the Visibility:** There are three possibilities. 
    1. **Hidden:** All jams start out hidden. As long as a jam remains hidden, only the jam's organizer(s) can view it. 
    2. **Unlisted:** When you un-hide an unlisted jam, it is published and anyone with the URL can visit the site. However, an unlisted jam will not appear in the [public listing of active jams](http://jams.gamejolt.com/browse/active). This is a good choice for you if you want to run a small, private jam. Sure, it's possible that someone could stumble across it and try to submit a game, but as organizer, you have the ability to reject entries. 
    3. **Visible:** Making a jam visible will unleash it upon the world for any and all to see. It will show up in the [list of active jams](http://jams.gamejolt.com/browse/active). 
- **Previewing:** Before you un-hide your jam, or before you publish any new cosmetic alterations, you might want to see how it will look through the eyes of a non-organizer. Simply click View Jam in the top right. Once you're done surveying your new page, you can go back to editing it (click Edit Page) or return to the jam overview (Manage Jam). 
- **Saving:** After making any changes that you want to keep, be sure to click Save Jam. 
- **Deleting a Jam:** If you want to get rid of a jam, you can do it here. See those 3 little dots in the upper right next to Edit Jam?  Cick them, then click Remove Jam. Be sure you want to delete the jam; this action is irreversible. 

### Jam Organizers

This page lists all organizers of the jam and allows you to add new ones. As the creator and original organizer of the jam, you have the power to anoint other organizers. To grant someone organizer access, just click the Add Organizer button and enter the person's Game Jolt username (not their developer name). Should you need to dismiss an organizer, you can do so by clicking the Remove Organizer button next to their username. Organizers who you add can do anything you can do except add and remove organizers themselves.

### Manage Pages

This is where you add content to your jam's header and webpages, and where you add new pages. Every jam starts with two pages: Home and Games. If you enable livestreaming, your jam will also have a Livestreaming page. You can create any other pages you like. Also, you can change the order in which pages appear on the jam's navigation bar by dragging the pages to another spot on the list (grab the double arrow to the right of each page title to drag them). 

- **Header:** Click the Edit Content button to, well, edit the text in the jam header. You'll see that the header is pre-populated with the jam name as a heading and the countdown timer widget below it. Don't be verbose here. Remember that the header will appear atop every jam page and the image, jam name, and countdown are often enough to put there. You can use [Markdown](http://jams.gamejolt.com/help/markdown) to style your header text, just as you can on the homepage (see next bullet point).  
- **Home:** Your jam's homepage should contain enough information to let any reader know what the jam is all about. Writing and editing content on jam pages is done in [Markdown](http://jams.gamejolt.com/help/markdown), which is easy to use and allows you to do things like styling text and adding links and images. You can add video or audio snippets to your page by [using widgets](http://jams.gamejolt.com/help/widgets). Any or all of the following information could go on the homepage: 
    - **Dates:** When does the jam start and when does it end? Be specific. 
    - **Rules:** Even the most laid back jam could use a few rules to guide participants. If the rules are numerous and/or complex, you might want to create a new page to put them on (see Organizer Created Pages, below). 
    - **How to Submit:** It is essential to explain to participants how to enter games in the jam. In case you don't know, they do this by adding a game to Game Jolt and putting the jam hashtag anywhere in the game's description. 
    - **Theme:** If your jam has a theme, the homepage is the place to announce it. If you're not revealing the theme until the jam starts, you can let participants know that. You can even tease the theme, or explain how it will be chosen. And if you're announcing your theme at the start of the jam, remember to update your homepage when the time comes! 
    - **Judging:** If the jam is a competition, let everyone know how the games will be judged. Will voting be open to anyone or only to people who have entered a game in the jam? If a jury will be picking the winners, people would probably like to know who's on the jury. 
    - **Contact:** This info is all too often left off of homepages. If people have questions about the jam, who do they contact and how? It's a good idea to provide an email address or at least a Twitter handle. If you don't want people sending questions to your personal email address, you could always create a new one just for the jam. 
- **Games:** This page will display all the games that have been entered in the jam. You can hide games or accept late entries via the Game Entries tab (see below). Here, you can set the page's visibility on or off. The Games page is visible by default, but you can hide it if you wish. 
- **Organizer Created Pages:** To create a new page for your jam site, click Add a Page (located under the list of pages). Next, you'll need to give your new page a title and a URL. The page title will appear as a link on your jam's navigation bar. Ideally, the URL should be similar to the title. Once created, the page will show up in the list of pages.  
    - **Editing and Visibility:** After creating a new page, you can add and edit content (see "Home", above). All organizer created pages start out hidden, so click the Visibility switch from Off to On when you're ready for yours to be viewable. 
    - **Examples:** Since Game Jolt Jams launched, jam organizers have created many different kinds of custom pages to hold content that they felt didn't belong crowded onto the homepage. The titles of some organizer created pages have been: Rules, FAQs, Resources, Tips, Examples, Media, Press, Contact, and Prizes. 

### Game Entries

On this page, you'll find a list of every game that's been entered in the jam, along with the developer's name and the date on which the game was entered. New games will automatically appear here when they are added to Game Jolt and tagged with your jam hashtag.

- **Removing Games:** If your jam has any strict rules, there is a chance that some games will break them. For this reason, or for any other reason, you can easily hide a game from the jam. Just locate it in the Jam Games list and click the Hide Game button next to it. The game will disappear from the jam's Games page. It will still appear on your list here, in case you decide to accept it into the jam later. To do this, simply click the Unhide Game button next to it. 
- **Late Entries:** If a game is submitted to the jam after the deadline, a new Late Entries tab will appear on this page. This tab will list all games entered after the jam has ended. It's up to you how to handle them. In our jams, we generally have a short grace period to allow for slow uploads and other network issues. To accept a late entry into the jam, click the Approve Game button next to it. If you need to reject a late game that has been previously approved, find it in the Jam Games list and click the Reject Game button next to it. 

### Activity Feed

Your jam's activity feed is turned on by default and appears on the jam homepage. The activity feed is a great way for participants and observers to keep informed and stay involved in the jam, especially if it's taking place entirely online. If for some reason you wish to disable the activity feed, just click the switch to change it from ON to OFF. You can also change the jam's Twitter hashtag on this page. To move the activity feed from the homepage to another page, go to Manage Pages and delete the widget code ( {% activity-feed %} ) from the body of the homepage, then add it to the body of another page. If your homepage is crowded, you may want to create a custom page to house the activity feed. 

### Voting

This is where you activate and set up voting/judging (these terms are basically interchangeable in regards to Game Jolt Jams). Voting is turned off by default, so to enable it, click the switch to turn it ON. Then, you need to fill out some information. You can change anything on this page up until the voting period starts.

- **Voting End Date and Time:** Figure out how much time you want to allow for the judging process and select a date and time on which to end it. The voting end date and time must be set for after the jam's end date and time. You don't have to set a start date for voting; the voting period will begin the instant the jam ends. 
- **Who can vote?** You have a choice between allowing anyone with a Game Jolt account to vote (Users) or limiting voting to participants in the jam (Participants). Choose your radio button with care. 
- **Voting Type:** Now you must decide how games will be scored. Game Jolt Jams lets voters judge games by assigning them numerical ratings from 1-5, with 5 being the best. You can choose if games are given overall ratings or if multiple scores are given in different categories for each game. 
- **Categories:** After you set up voting and you save the page, if you have chosen Categories, you will be able to create them now. Click Add Category and then enter a category name (such as Graphics, Audio, Use of Theme, Fun, or whatever categories you devise). Optionally, you can give each category a description. Descriptions aren't necessary if the category name is clear enough, but they can be used to give voters clarification or guidance. 

### Livestreams

Here, you can enable Twitch.tv livestream integration by setting the big switch to ON. If livestreams are enabled, a Livestreams page will appear when the jam begins. Participants can have their livestreams appear there while they are live. All they have to do is enter their Twitch name and then start streaming. 

- **Why?** Livestreaming development is a great way to participate in an online jam. Seeing the rapid development process unfold is instructional for other devs, interesting for gamers, and helps maintain a sense of everyone being in this thing together--especially if participants are not gathered in a single physical location. 

There's one more important ingredient in a successful jam that this guide has not covered, but it bears mentioning here, in bold: Don't forget to have fun!

Do you have any questions? Can you think of anything that should be added to this guide? Want to give us feedback about the Jams system or request new features? Send us an email at [contact@gamejolt.com](mailto:contact@gamejolt.com).
