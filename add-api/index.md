## How do I add scoreboards and trophies to my game?

First, you need to implement the Game API in your game's code. Then, you can add score tables and trophies to your game.

### Implementing the API

Implementing the Game API will allow you to not only create scoreboards and trophies, but also store data online, log game sessions, and more. Here is an [overview of the Game API](http://gamejolt.com/developers/achievements-new/) and here is the [documentation](http://gamejolt.com/api/doc/game) you will need to implement it. 

### Adding scores and trophies

After you have implemented the Game API in your game, you can then create scoreboards and trophies for it. Go to your [developer dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/) and select the game from under "Your Games". You will be taken to the game's management page. Head over to the "Game API" tab, where you will be able to choose from "Trophies", "Scores", "Data Storage", and "API Settings".
