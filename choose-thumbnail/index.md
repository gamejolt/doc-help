## Choosing a thumbnail image

Think of your game's thumbnail as its box cover if it was sold off a shelf in a store (they used to do that, you know). It should attract attention and give an impression of what the game is like.

A good thumbnail should be more than just a title floating on a blank background. Many good thumbnails are simply well-framed screenshots with the game's title added. Other good ones are images created specifically for the thumbnail using art from the game.

Don't stress out too much about getting your image to the correct size; there's a handy cropper tool to make it easy for you. But you should still start out with a high-quality original image.

Only use images that you created. Don't use another game's image, an internet meme, something you found on Deviantart, or anything like that.

### Mature content in thumbnails

Please don't choose an image for your thumbnail that contains nudity, swear words, or adult-oriented imagery. This only applies to thumbnails, not to other images, because they show up on public lists and in search results; once someone visits a game page, there is a maturity rating on display and someone can make their own decision about whether to stay on the page and play the game.
