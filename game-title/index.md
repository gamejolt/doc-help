## Choosing a game title

All games need a title. Titles are of obvious importance because they, along with a thumbnail image, covey the first impression someone will have of your game. In general, a your game's name should be simple and memorable, and unique enough to distinguish it from other games that already exist. Ideally, your game should be easy to find by simply entering its name into a search engine. 

### Mature content in titles

Your game's title should also be clean. If it contains the "F-word" or a swear word of that magnitude, please replace one or more of its letters with asterisks or similar characters. This will keep browsing friendly for people who do not wish to view mature content. This only applies to titles and thumbnails because they show up in lists and search results; once someone visits a game page, there is a maturity rating on display and one can make their own decision about whether to read the description and play the game.
