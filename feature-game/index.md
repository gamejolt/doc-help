## Will you feature my game?

There's no secret or guaranteed way to get featured on the homepage. We just pick games that really grab us. And a lot of great games get posted, so deciding on just one a day is always a tough decision. Make a game that shows some serious originality, passion, and pizzazz, and there's a good chance it will at least be in the running.
