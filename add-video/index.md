## Adding video to my game page

The moving image is an incredibly effective medium. Humans just love it. So spruce up your game page with some video! Adding a video is as simple as entering a link to Youtube or Vimeo and giving it a title and, optionally, a description.

To add video, go to your [developer dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/) and select a game from under "Your Games". You will be taken to the game's management page. Visit the "Media" tab and start adding video.

You can add videos that you recorded or ones that other people made about your game. Here are some ideas for what kinds of videos you can add:

- Game trailers 
- Gameplay footage 
- Development timelapse 
- Dev diaries 
- Let's plays 
- Video reviews 

Note that if your game is a work-in-progress and you haven't posted a build, videos are probably the best way of showing off the progress of your development.
