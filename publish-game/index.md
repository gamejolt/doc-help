## How do I publish my game?

When you are ready to publish your game, head over to your [dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/) and select the game from the list under "Your Games". You will be taken to the game's management page. Here, you can publish the game by clicking/tapping "Unhide your game."

### Prerequisites

Before you can publish your game, it needs two things:

1. [A thumbnail image](link to What is a thumbnail image?) 

2. [A maturity rating](link to What is a maturity rating?)

Adding other things to your game page, like screenshots and the actual game files, are not required for publication, but are highly recommended.
