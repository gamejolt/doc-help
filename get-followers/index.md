## How do I get followers for my game?

It's pretty easy to get people to follow your game. To get people interested in your game, give it a nice thumbnail, a decent description, a good-looking header, and plenty of screenshots. Post some videos and some music. Make news posts, but not so often that they become spam. Reply to comments on your game pages.

Don't announce that you'll post a build when you get X number of followers; instead, give potential followers some evidence that you're making progress on your game. Don't be secretive and assume people will be excited about your game because you are; use your game page to show why being a follower is worth their time and inbox space.
