## What is a header?

Headers are the big, banner-like images that adorn the tops of game pages. They are optional but highly, highly recommended. Headers make for a splendid looking page.

You might want to experiment with different images to see what looks good as a header. Screenshots often turn out well, but some of the nicest looking headers are created for the purpose.
