1. Pick a name and a password, and enter your email address. 
2. Answer "Yes" to the question "Are you a developer?" 
3. Hit the "Sign Up" button. 
4. You'll be sent a confirmation email. Visit the link in this email to verify your account. 

You can also sign up for a Game Jolt account using [Facebook](http://gamejolt.com/auth/social-login/facebook/) or [Twitter](http://gamejolt.com/auth/social-login/twitter/).

### If you already have a gamer account:
