## How much ad revenue do I get?

Game Jolt shares ad revenue with developers. You get 30% of the revenue generated by any ads on your game pages and blog pages. The actual amount per ad impression varies from day to day as we work to place the best, most lucrative ads on the site.

Revenue is calculated daily and automatically accrues. Reporting generally lags a day or two behind real time. You can withdraw any amount in your account at any time by transferring the funds to a Paypal account. To set this up, simply enter your Paypal email address [here](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/developer/withdraw-funds/). Your revenue information is displayed on your developer dashboard.
