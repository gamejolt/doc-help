## Making a quick header

If you don't want to make a custom image for your header, use a screenshot. A lot of screenshots turn out really nicely when blown up to header size.

When taking your screenshot, run the game full-screen or in the highest resolution it supports. Make sure to capture the image as a JPG if it is pixel art, and as a PNG otherwise.

### PNGs

PNG images should not be enlarged because they may become blurry. So if you have a PNG, upload it and see what you've got. It probably looks pretty good. If it's not quite to your liking try starting out with a different shot, or try cropping the original image to rearrange the layout.

### JPGs

If you have a JPG image that is already 1900 or 2000 pixels wide (or wider), it is ready to upload. If it is less than that, use some imaging software to scale it up to 2000 pixels wide. Don't resize it by percentage and make sure to preserve the aspect ratio. Don't resample the image and don't sharpen it.
