## How do I unhide/hide my game?

This is it, the big moment. Once your game has a thumbnail and a maturity rating, you will be able to unleash it upon an unsuspecting public.

But WAIT! Before you unhide your game, you can add media, music, news, and actual game builds to make your game page all that it can be.

When you're ready, visit your [dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/) and select the game from the list under "Your Games". You will be taken to the game's management page. Here, you can publish the game by clicking/tapping "Unhide your game."

### Hiding a published game

It is just as easy to hide a game that you've already published. Head to your [dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/) and select the game from the list under "Your Games". Then, simply choose "Hide your game".
