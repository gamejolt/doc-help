# What is Quick Play?

Quick Play is a way for gamers to play a downloadable build without actually downloading and extracting the files. It's a good way for someone to preview a game. Only games with a .exe. file work with Quick Play. After you've added a downloadable build, you will be able to set it up.

## How do I enable Quick Play?

To set up Quick Play, go to your [developer dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/) and select a game from under "Your Games". On the game's overview page, select the "Builds" tab. Next to the build, click "Setup Quick Play". You can enable Quick Play by simply ticking the box. If you uploaded a single .exe file, no further action is required. If the executable file is within a .zip file, you must specify the filename and path.
