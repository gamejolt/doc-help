## How do I edit/manage my game?

Head over to your [dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/) and select the game from the list under "Your Games". You will be taken to the game's overview page. From here, you'll be able to manage and edit every aspect of your game.

You begin on the Overview tab. To the left, you'll see the other available tabs, including "Edit Details", "Thumbnail", "Page Header", and "Maturity Rating".
