# The left navigation menu disappeared! What do I do?

Don't worry, the navigation menu is just hidden. There are two ways to unhide the menu:

- Click the "Toggle Menu" icon on the top left.
- Use the keyboard shortcut **m**.

You can also use either of these options to hide the menu again.

Furthermore, you can use the keyboard shortcut **x** to toggle both the navigation menu on the left and chat on the right.
