# How do I publish/hide my game page?

This is it, the big moment. Once your game has a thumbnail and a maturity rating, and a build if it's complete, you will be able to unleash it upon an unsuspecting public.

But **wait**! Before you publish your game page, you can [add media](/game-media/index.md), [music](/add-music/index.md), [news](/news-update/index.md), and actual [game builds](/add-build/index.md) to make your page all that it can be.

When you're ready, visit your [dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/) and choose the game from under "Your Games". You will be taken to the game's overview page. Click "Edit Details" on the left. Scroll down to "Visibility" and select "Published." Your game is no longer hidden!

## Hiding a published game

It's just as easy to hide a game that you've already published. Head to your [dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/) and choose the game from under "Your Games". Go to "Edit Details", scroll down to "Visibility", and select "Hidden".
