# How does ad revenue sharing work?

Game Jolt shares ad revenue with developers. As a developer, you get 30% of the revenue generated by any ads on your pages. Your revenue information is displayed on your developer dashboard. The actual amount you get per ad impression varies from day to day as we work to place the best, most lucrative ads on the site.

Revenue is calculated daily and automatically accrues. Reporting generally lags a day or two behind real time. You can withdraw any amount at any time by transferring the funds to a Paypal account. There is no minimum withdrawal amount or waiting period. To make a withdrawal, enter your Paypal email address [here](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/developer/withdraw-funds/).
