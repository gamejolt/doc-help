# How do I use my developer blog?

If you're a developer, did you know you have a blog on Game Jolt? Well you do, and it's accessible from your dashboard. Your developer blog is an excellent tool to keep fans and followers engaged, and to convert new ones. Post about gaming, game dev, or life in general; it's your blog. Remember that if you have news about a specific game, you should make a news update instead.

Blog posts are written in Markdown.
