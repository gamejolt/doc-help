# How do I unhide/hide game builds?

If you are ready for people to play your game, remember to unhide any builds.

When you upload a build, it will be hidden by default. Even if your game page has been published, you will need to unhide your build in order for it to show up on the page.

To unhide a build, go to your [dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/) and select the game from the list of "Your Games". Go to the "Builds/Files" tab, then select the package containing the build you want to unhide. Click "Publish".

To hide a build again, simply click "Unpublish".
