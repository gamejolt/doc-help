# What Is My Game Token?

When you make an account on Game Jolt, you get a Game Token. Named after the coins you drop into arcade cabinets and subway turnstiles, your token is a string of numbers and letters that lets you log into games that use Game Jolt's Game API.

Your token is different from your password and should stay that way. If someone gets ahold of your token, they can access your game data, but they won't be able to sign into the site and mess with your account.

When you play a game that uses the Game API, your token is used to access score tables, trophies, cloud data storage, and other features made possible by the API. Some API-enabled games log you in automatically; others require you to manually enter your username and your token in-game.

## Where can I find my Game Token?

### Browser
You can find your token any time at the top right corner of your screen, by clicking your avater. To see your token, after clicking your avatar, click "Game Token". Your game token will be shown to you! Your game token can also be changed from here. If you change it, be sure to choose something different than your password.

### Client
If you are using the client, right-click the Game Jolt icon on your task bar. If you do not see the Game Jolt icon, click the little up arrow where the wifi icon is, then you can right click the Game Jolt icon. A menu should appear, once it does, there is an option that says "Game Token". When you click it, a pop-up menu will appear inside the client window. Make sure the window is open so you can see your token! Your game token can also be changed from here. If you change it, be sure to choose something different than your password.

## Keep Your Token Safe
Remember that your token and your password should never be the same thing. Don't share your password with anyone. Game Jolt staff will never ask you for it.
