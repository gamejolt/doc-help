# Chat disappeared! What do I do?

Don't worry, chat just got hidden. There are two ways to unhide chat:

- Click the "Toggle Chat" icon on the top right.
- Use the keyboard shortcut **c**.

You can also use either of these options to hide chat again.

In addition, you can use the keyboard shortcut **x** to toggle both the navigation menu on the left and chat on the right.
