# Friends on Game Jolt

You can exchange private messages with your friends via Game Jolt chat. In the future, you may be able to see information about your friends, such as what game they are currently playing and what other games they've played recently.

## How do I friend someone?

If you want to add someone as a friend, send them a friend request. If they accept your request, then the two of you will become friends.

To send a friend request to someone, use the "Send Friend Request" link near the top of their profile page.

## How do I accept a friend request?

You can see all of your pending friend requests, both incoming and outgoing, via the "Friend Requests" icon on the top navigation bar. Use this icon to expand your list of pending requests, which is divided into two tabs: "Friend Requests" and "Sent Requests".

Accept a friend request by using the "Add Friend" button next to the person's username on the "Friend Requests" tab. The person will be notified of your acceptance.

Accepted friend requests will show up in your [activity feed](http://gamejolt.com/activity/all?filter=friendship-accept).

## How do I decline a friend request?

If you don't wish to accept a friend request, you can use the "Dismiss Request" button next to the person's username on the "Friend Requests" tab. The person will be not be notified of the dismissal (so no hard feelings).

## How do I cancel a friend request?

If you sent a friend request in error or simply changed your mind, and if the request is still pending, you can cancel it. Use the "Friend Requests" icon on the top nav bar to expand your list of pending requests, then go to the "Sent Requests" tab and hit the "Cancel" button next to the username. The person will be none the wiser.

## How do I unfriend someone?

To dismiss someone as your friend, visit their profile page and hit "More" (under their username). Then, use the "Remove Friend" button. You will need to confirm this action in the dialogue window that appears.
