# How do I report a Game Jolt user for abusive behavior?

We don't tolerate hate speech, personal attacks, or other abusive behavior anywhere on the site. This includes chat, comments, the forums, and anywhere else.

If you want to report someone for abusive behavior, send the details to [contact@gamejolt.com](mailto:contact@gamejolt.com). Let us know the person's username and what they did. Whenever possible, include evidence such as screenshots.
