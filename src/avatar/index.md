# How do I change my avatar?

Game Jolt uses [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com/) to serve up the avatars on the site. If you don't have a Gravatar account, go set one up at [gravatar.com](http://gravatar.com/) using the same email address you use for Game Jolt. Then, upload your avatar image.

After a sort delay, your avatar will start appearing on Game Jolt. If it doesn't show up after a while, try clearing your browser's cache.

If you want to change your avatar again, upload a new image to Gravatar and associate it with the email address you use for Game Jolt.

We recommend changing your avatar to something other than the default ninja (even though it's pretty cute). It's a simple thing to do and it makes you stand out from the crowd wherever your avatar appears, like on your game pages, next to your comments, and so on.
