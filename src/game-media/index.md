# What type of media can I add to my game page?

Images and videos are the two types of media that you can add to your game page (not counting music, which gets its own section). Media is vital to getting your game page into a presentable state for the public. A game page without any media just looks unfinished, and it doesn't attract as much attention as one with plenty of images--both moving and still.
