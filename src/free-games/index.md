# What kind of games can I put on Game Jolt?

Game Jolt is currently focused exclusively on free indie games. These can be hobbyist creations, labors of love, early prototypes, jam games, student projects, fan games, experiments, art games, alt games, or any other kind of game--as long as they are free.

Games can be open source, Creative Commons licensed, or all rights reserved; they just have to be uploaded by their developer and they have to be completely free. All developers are welcome. Publishers are not allowed to upload games.
