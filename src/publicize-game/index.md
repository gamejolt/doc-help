# How do I publicize my game?

Once you've published your game and it shows up in New Releases, you can expect a few people to stumble across it and play it. But you shouldn't just wait around and hope your game happens to go viral. If you want more plays, you're going to have to publicize it. Here's how:

## News updates

News posts are a great way to get your game attention. Post news updates whenever anything genuinely interesting happens with your game. Followers will be sent notifications and the news will be archived on your game page. It could even show up on the site's homepage.

## Blog posts

Your developer blog is an excellent tool to keep fans engaged, and to convert new ones. Post about gaming, game dev, or life in general; it's your blog. Remember that if you're posting news about a specific game, you should make a news update.

## Social media

Tweet the link every day. Post it on Facebook. Write about it on Tumblr. Do whatever it is you do on Google+ and any other social network in which you're involved. Oh, and if you're not on any social networks, you really should at least get a Twitter account. Twitter is a goldmine of indie game development news and networking and a great tool for publicizing games.

## Rate and comment

You should play, rate, and comment on other people's games. This can encourage them to check out your games. It also spreads your name around. If people keep seeing your avatar on games they like, they might get curious and check out your profile.

## Reply to comments

When people leave comments on your game, reply to them! Players who take the time to comment are more likely to do so in the future if they know they have been heard. Use replies to give thanks for praise, address criticism, and evaluate suggestions. Comments and replies can become a dialogue that results in a better game.

## Email press

Seek press coverage by emailing blogs and indie game news sites. Email a lot of them. Don't be shy; the worst thing they can do is ignore you. Expect to receive little if any response, but all the effort becomes worth it when you see your game recommended online.

## Contact let's players

Youtube and Twitch broadcasters have become hugely important tastemakers and sources of publicity. And they want games to play! Find some of them that play games like yours and email them.

## Keep in touch

Stay in contact with other developers and with the people who play your game; they are the best sources of thoughtful feedback. Furthermore, they are frequent transmitters of word-of-mouth publicity.
