# My comment/post is not appearing! What's up?

If your comment or forum post is not showing up yet, don't resubmit it. Give it some time; it might be awaiting moderation.

Something in your post or comment might have gotten it tagged as spam by our filters. A moderator will review it as soon as possible and, if it's not spam, release it into the wild.

Here are some of the things that might trigger the spam filters:

- Links
- Very long messages
- Non-English words
- Repetition
- Certain email domains
- Unexplainable forces

Please be patient. Your comment or post will be reviewed by a human. If it's been over 24 hours and you're tired of waiting, feel free to email [contact@gamejolt.com](mailto:contact@gamejolt.com).
