# How do I become a developer on Game Jolt?

On Game Jolt, everyone starts out with a gamer account. Your account changes to developer when you add your first game.

Simply go to your [dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard) and hit the "Add Game" button to get started.

## How do I change my account back to gamer?

If for some reason you wish to become a gamer again, just [email us](mailto:contact@gamejolt.com).
