# What is Voltage?

Voltage is Game Jolt's community-driven rating system. It's a measure of quality based on user ratings. A game's voltage reflects the average of all the ratings that have been given to it.

You can see a game's voltage by checking the voltmeter icon (the series of uneven bars) displayed near the top right of the game page. A voltmeter also appears under a game's thumbnail in the game listings.

Though the voltmeter has 10 bars, it does not correspond to a numerical score from 1-10. Rather, the voltmeter is a purely visual representation of a game's average rating. It's something you can check at a glance.

If you want to see all of the ratings that a game has received, you can view its ratings breakdown via the bar graph icon under "Details" on the game page.

You can also get an idea of a game's quality by checking the number of followers and the number of ratings, both of which are displayed next to the voltmeter on the game page.

## How do I rate a game?

To rate a game, visit its page and give it from 1 to 5 lightning bolts.

Each number is the rough equivalent of the following opinions:

- 1 - Terrible
- 2 - Meh
- 3 - Good
- 4 - Great
- 5 - Perfecto!

When you rate a game, your rating is factored into the game's voltage and is added to the ratings breakdown. Remember to leave a comment when you rate a game!

### Can I change my rating?

You can change your rating at any time. Select a different number of lightning bolts and your new rating will replace your prior rating.

### Multiple ratings

It is impossible for one user to give more than one rating to any one game. Ratings don't "stack". If someone rates a game and then rates it again, only their most recent rating will count towards the voltage.
