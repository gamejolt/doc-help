# How big can my game be?

Your game can take as many hours to complete and be as ambitious in scope as you want, though we recommend starting out much smaller. Oh, you're probably asking about the maximum file size. In that case, you have a limit of 1,000MB (that's 1GB) per build. If your game is larger than that, try compressing audio, video, and textures.
