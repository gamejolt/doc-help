# How do I play games on Game Jolt?

First, [find a game](https://help.gamejolt.com/find-games) to play. 

Found a game? Great! Visit the game's page and see if it's playable. If it's still in development, it may or may not be playable. All complete and canceled games are playable.

If an in-development game is not yet playable, there will be a message letting you know this at the top of the game page. You can [follow the game](https://help.gamejolt.com/follow-games) to be notified when it's released.

When a game is playable, you can find any builds that have been released on its game page under the heading "Releases". Builds are what you play.

Some games can be played right in your browser. Other games need to be downloaded and run from your hard drive. You can play or download the game build by using the appropriate button in the grey box under "Releases". The grey box will also show you what platforms are supported by the game.

## Browser builds

To launch a browser game, use the "Play" button in the grey release box.

In order to play a browser build, make sure that your browser is updated to the latest version. In addition, some browser builds require plugins to run.

**HTML:** HTML games will run in any modern, updated browser. No need to worry about plugins.

**Unity:** Unity web builds require the [Unity Web Player](https://unity3d.com/webplayer) plugin. The plugin does not work with Chrome unless you [manually enable NPAPI](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/6213033) (this option will not be available starting with Chrome version 45). The Unity Web Player is not compatible with Linux.

**Flash:** Flash builds require the [Adobe Flash Player](https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/). The Flash Player comes built-in with Chrome, but must be installed in other browsers. If a Flash game does not work for you in Chrome, make sure you have [enabled PPAPI plugins](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/6213033).

**Silverlight:** Microsoft Silverlight has been discontinued, but you can still play older Silverlight games with the [Silverlight plugin](http://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/get-started/install/default.aspx). It does not work with Chrome unless you [manually enable NPAPI](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3058254) (this option will not be available starting with Chrome version 45). Silverlight is not compatible with Linux.

**Java:** To play Java games, you need to have [Java installed](https://java.com/en/download/). Java does not work with Chrome unless you [manually enable NPAPI](https://java.com/en/download/faq/chrome.xml#npapichrome) (this option will not be available starting with Chrome version 45).

## Downloadable builds

The playability of downloadable builds depends on your computer's operating system and configuration. Game Jolt will detect your operating system and serve you the appropriate build in the grey release box. Simply use the "Download" button to start downloading.

If you wish to download a build for a different operating system, you can use the button with 3 dots on it (to the right of the "Download" button). This will open a dropdown menu from which you can download any other builds that are available. If the button is not there, no other operating systems are supported.

### Launching a downloaded game

After downloading the build that matches your OS, you can usually launch the game by running the .exe or application file contained in the download. Some downloaded games need to be installed on your computer, but most can be launched without any installation.

Some downloads are nothing but an executable file, which you can run without further ado; other downloads are archive files, such as a .zip or a .rar. You should generally extract archives into a folder before trying to run the executable files within them. You can use a program such as [WinRAR](http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm) to extract archives (WinRAR is not free, but comes with a trial license). 

## Support

If you have trouble launching a game, whether it's a browser or downloadable build, you should [contact the game's developer](https://help.gamejolt.com/contact#how_do_i_contact_developers). Sometimes the cause is a bug that can be fixed; other times it may be an issue with your system configuration.
