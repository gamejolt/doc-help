# How do I publish my game?

When you are ready to publish your game, head over to your [dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/) and select the game from the list under "Your Games". You will be taken to the game's overview page. Here, you can complete the required set-up steps and then publish your game.

Before you can publish your game, it needs at least two, maybe three, things:

1. [A thumbnail image](/thumbnail-image/index.md) 

2. [A maturity rating](/maturity/index.md)

3. [One or more builds](/add-build/index.md), if it is not a Work-in-Progress.

Adding other attention-grabbing things to your game page, like media, music, and a page header, is not required for publication, but is highly recommended. 

- [Adding images to my game page](/add-image/index.md)

- [Adding video to my game page](/add-video/index.md)

- [Adding music to my game page](/add-music/index.md)

- [What is a page header?](/page-header/index.md)

If you want people to actually play your game, you will need to upload a build or builds.

- [Adding builds/files to my game page](add-build/index.md)

Finally, on the game's overview page, select the "Edit Details" tab on the left. Scroll down to "Visibility" and set it to "Published." Your game is no longer hidden! If you want to unpublish it, just set "Visibility" back to "Hidden".
