# How do I find games to play?

There are several ways to discover games on Game Jolt:

- Check out the Featured Games section at the top of the [homepage](http://gamejolt.com/).

- Browse other categories further down the [homepage](http://gamejolt.com/), such as [All-Time Best Games](http://gamejolt.com/games/best) and This Week's Best Games.

- Find more categories on the left navigation menu, like [Hot](http://gamejolt.com/games/hot) and [Newly Added](http://gamejolt.com/games/new).

- Look further down the navigation menu for Featured Tags, such as [#horror](http://gamejolt.com/tag/horror).

- Browse game genres. Choose a genre from the row under Featured Games on the [homepage](http://gamejolt.com/).

- See personalized game recommendations at the bottom of any game page.

- If you like a game by a certain developer, you can find links to their latest games on their profile page. If they have more games than are shown, use the View All button to see the full list. From a developer's game list, you can follow them and be notified when they upload new games. 

- If you find a gamer with similar tastes as you, browse their game library and playlists. You can follow playlists to add them to [your own library](http://gamejolt.com/library) and get notifications when they are updated with more games. 

- Use the search box at the top of any page to find a specific game or developer.

- Ask for recommendations in General Chat or in the [Gaming Forum](http://gamejolt.com/community/forums/gaming/3).

There are even more ways to find games on the site, but these should be enough to get you started!
