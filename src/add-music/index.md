# Adding music to my game page

To add your game's soundtrack to your game page, go to your [developer dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/) and select the game from under "Your Games". You will be taken to the game's overview page. Visit the "Music" tab, where you can upload songs in MP3 format and give each one a title. All of the songs will show up on your game page in a music player. In addition, people will be able to download a ZIP file of the entire soundtrack.

Also, there is a little experiment called [Game Jolt Radio](http://gamejolt.fm/) that streams random tracks from the site. Uploading songs gets them added to the pool.
