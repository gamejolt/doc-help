# What are the rules for putting a game on Game Jolt?

When you click or tap "Add a Game" on your developer dashboard, the first thing you'll see are the rules for uploading a game to Game Jolt. The rules are there for a reason. You have to agree to them before you add a game, and if your game breaks the rules, it will be removed. Read the rules and abide by them. That way everyone stays happy and nobody gets hurt. That last bit was a joke. The rules are serious, though.

## The rules:

- Game Jolt is currently only accepting free games. There must be no requirement to pay in order to play your game. 
- Don't upload games you didn't make. If you are not the game's developer, don't add the game to the site. If you're a fan, encourage the developer to add it themselves. 
- Publishers are not allowed to upload games; only developers are. Remember: This is Indie. 
- Our name is "Game Jolt". As such, only actual games may be uploaded to the site. No applications, software, or tools are allowed at this time. We may accept these in the future or on a case by case basis, but for now, let's just keep it to games. 
- No stripped-down demos or "lite" versions of commercial games are permitted. You must upload a totally free version of your game, and it must be as complete a version as is publicly available. 
- We welcome and encourage you to add games that are incomplete and still in development, as long as they are tagged as Works-in-Progress. However, you should keep your game hidden until you have something to show. Work-in-Progress games do not have to be playable, but they must be further along than the concept stage. Before you unhide the game, make sure you at least have some screenshots and an informative description. 
- Do not add links to download or play your game on other sites unless you have already uploaded it to Game Jolt. You can't use your game page as an advertisement for another site. 
- For browser-based games, don't display ads in the preloader. We already offer a way to [monetize your games](http://gamejolt.com/developers/ad-sharing/) on the site. Upload an ad-free version of your game, or block the ads from showing. Domain names to block are: 
    - gamejolt.com 
    - *.gamejolt.com 
    - gamejolt.net 
    - *.gamejolt.net
