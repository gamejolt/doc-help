# How do I report a stolen game?

You can report stolen games or games that use stolen art, music, or other assets. Just send an email to [contact@gamejolt.com](contact@gamejolt.com) and include the game's URL, as well as a link to where the game or assets originated.

You can also report stolen assets used as images on a game page, used for a thumbnail, etc.
