# How do I edit my profile bio?

You can edit your bio at any time on your profile's [user information page](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/profile/edit).

Be sure to save any changes you make.

## What should I put in my bio?

A bio is optional, but it is really the meat of your profile. We suggest that you take some time to fill out your bio. This is a chance to tell people a little about yourself and what kind of games you like to play and/or make. 

Feel free to put in links to your personal website, blog, Patreon page, or other relevant sites. You can also include other contact information if you wish, such as your SteamID, Skype Name, or email address. But if you do, be aware that strangers may contact you! Always be careful sharing your personal info.

## Twitter and Facebook 

Don't put your Twitter and Facebook links in your bio. Instead, [link them directly](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/linked-accounts) to your account. They will appear big and bold on your profile page, making it easier for fans, staff, press, and so on to follow you and contact you.
