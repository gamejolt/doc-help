# What is the development status of my game?

When you add a game to the site, you must indicate your game's development status. You can change it at any time. You must choose one of three options:

- **Finished:** Your game is complete. You're uploading a build, and that build is stable. You might upload fixes or other small updates, but you don't expect to make any major changes. 
- **Work-in-Progress:** Your game is still in development. You might have an alpha/beta/test build for people to play, but it may be unstable. Major updates are planned. 
- **Canceled:** Your game is not what you'd consider complete, but you've ceased development on it. There is a playable build (stable or not), but you don't plan to ever update the game.
