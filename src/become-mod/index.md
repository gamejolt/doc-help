# Can I become a moderator?

Maybe one day. Most mods were regular users of the site for years before being picked and contributed heavily to the community through comments, forum posts, chat, and even making games.

Mods are hand-picked by admins and approved by other mods. People rarely, if ever, become mods by asking to be one.

If you want to be a mod, start out by contributing to the community and just generally being a source of positivity for all! If that happens, the chances are good that you'll be on our radar.
