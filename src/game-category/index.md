# Choosing a game category

When you add a game to the site, you have to choose a category for it. The category you pick is entirely up to you. Categories are meant to be helpful, not restrictive. They are signposts to aid gamers in finding the games they want to play.

The game categories are:

- Arcade 
- Action 
- Adventure 
- Platformer 
- Puzzle 
- RPG 
- Shooter 
- Sports 
- Strategy/Sim 
- Other
