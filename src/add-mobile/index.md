# Can I upload mobile games?

You are welcome to upload Android games. We haven't officially added Android as an operating system yet, but you can upload APK files as "Other" builds. Be sure to let people know the type of file it is in the description.

iOS and Windows Phone are closed platforms, so we cannot host iPhone/iPad or Windows Phone games.
