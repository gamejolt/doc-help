# What is voltage?

Voltage is Game Jolt's community-driven, weighted rating system. Voltage is a measure of game's quality and popularity.

Voltage is represented by the voltmeter icon near the top right of game pages.

You can also get an idea of a game's quality by checking the number of followers and ratings, which are displayed next to the voltmeter.

Voltage becomes more and more meaningful as the overall number of ratings increases. You can view a game's complete ratings breakdown on its page under "Details".

## How does voltage work?

All games start out with the same average voltage. Community ratings gradually increase or decrease the voltage. 

We use a system of weighted averages, in which higher occurrences of the same rating are given more value, or weight. Basically, the more 5's a game has, the more every 5 is worth. Weighted averages prevent a single 1 rating from wrecking the voltage of a game with a bunch of 5 ratings (and the other way around).

If you want to see all of the ratings a game has received, you can check out the ratings breakdown. Just click the bar graph icon under "Details".

## How do I rate a game?

To rate a game, visit its page and give it from 1 to 5 lightning bolts.

Each number is the rough equivalent of the following opinions:

- 1 - Terrible
- 2 - Meh
- 3 - Good
- 4 - Great
- 5 - Perfecto!

When you rate a game, your rating is factored into the game's voltage and is added to the ratings breakdown. 

You can change your rating at any time.

Remember to leave a comment when you rate a game!

## What about multiple ratings from the same person?

It is impossible for one user to give more than one rating to any one game. Ratings don't "stack". If you rate a game and then rate it again, your previous rating is replaced. Only your most recent rating counts.
