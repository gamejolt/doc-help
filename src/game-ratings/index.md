# What is voltage?

Voltage is Game Jolt's community driven rating system. High voltage indicates quality and popularity. 

# How does voltage work?

All games start with the same average score. Ratings gradually increase or decrease the score. 

We use a system of weighted averages, in which higher occurrences of the same score are given more value, or "weight".

Weighted averages prevent a game with a single 5 rating from trumping games with, for example, several 4 ratings. Similarly, the ranking of a game with several high ratings won't get destroyed by a single low rating.

# How do I rate a game?

To rate a game, visit its page and give it from 1 to 5 lightning bolts.

Each number is the rough equivalent of:

- 1 x
- 2 x
- 3 x
- 4 x
- 5 x

When you rate a game, your rating is factored into the game's voltage and is added to the ratings breakdown.
