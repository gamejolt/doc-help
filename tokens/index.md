# What Is My Token?

Named after the coins you drop into arcade cabinets and subway turnstiles, your token grants you access to games that use the Game API (for things like score tables, trophies, and cloud data storage).

Some API-enabled games will log you in automatically. Others will require you to enter your username and your token in-game, so it might be a good idea to jot it down if it's not something you can remember.

You can find your token by looking at the top of your screen to the right of your avatar and username. Next to "Your Token", simply click "Show". When you create a Game jolt account, you are assigned a token, but you can change your token at any time [here](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/profile/edit-token/).

If you change your token, be sure to choose something different than your password. Your token and password should never be the same. If someone gets ahold of your token, they can only access your game data. They won't be able to log in to the site with it and mess with your account. Remember not to share your password with anyone. Game Jolt staff will never ask you for it.
