## Adding music to my game page

To add songs, or an entire soundtrack, go to your [developer dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/) and select a game from under "Your Games". You will be taken to the game's management page. Visit the "Music" tab. There, you can upload an MP3 and give it a title. You can upload multiple MP3s, so why not put up the whole soundtrack?

Also, there is also a little experiment called [Game Jolt Radio](http://gamejolt.fm/) that streams random tracks from the site. Uploading songs gets your game's music added to the pool.
