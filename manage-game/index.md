## How do I edit/manage my game?

Head over to your [dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/) and select the game from the list under "Your Games". You will be taken to the game's management page. Here's where you'll manage and edit every aspect of your game.

You begin on the Overview tab. If you click the icon next to "Overview", you'll see a menu of your options, including "Edit Game", "Thumbnail", "Page Header", and "Maturity Rating".
