## What is the Game API?

Our Game API (application control interface) lets your games exchange information with the Game Jolt servers. Implementing the Game API will allow you to add a number of features to your game, including:

- Online score tables 
- Trophies (achievements) 
- Cloud data storage 
- Game session logging 
- User verification and auto-login Â  

### API libraries and plugins

Members of the Game Jolt community have written various libraries and plugins that make implementing the API fairly easy on most platforms. Consult the [overview of the Game API](http://gamejolt.com/developers/achievements-new/) for more information and links to the currently supported engines, languages, and tools. If you want to implement the API in your game, or write something for it yourself, here is the [documentation](http://gamejolt.com/api/doc/game). We welcome any contributions that make the API easier to use or more accessible!
