## What is a news post?

News posts are a great way to garner your game some new or renewed attention and they are the primary means of staying in contact with your game's followers. Post news updates whenever anything interesting happens with your game. Followers will be sent notifications and the news will be archived on your game page.

If you upload a new build of your game, you should take the time to make a news update. If your game just won a jam or an award, make a news update about it. If someone posted a new Let's Play, or if someone in the press wrote a review, go ahead and make a news update.

If you have something to post that is not news about a particular game, you can use your developer blog.
