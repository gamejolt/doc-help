## What images can I use for a header?

Here are the requirements and recommendations for header images:

- The image format can be PNG, JPG, or GIF. JPG is recommended for pixel art; otherwise, a PNG is recommended. 
- In general, your image should be as large as possible. In addition: 
    - The minimum recommended width is 1920. Images less wide than this will be automatically enlarged. The absolute minimum width is 950. 
    - The maximum width is 5120. 
- The height of your image should be from 15% to 35% of its width. 
    - Tip: To find an acceptable width, take the height and multiply it by 150 to 350. 
- For your header to look its best on mobile devices in portrait mode, make sure anything important is located near the center of the image. 
- Only use an original image created by you or your development team.
