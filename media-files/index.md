## What type of media files can I add to my game page?

Screenshots and videos are the two types of media that you can add to your game page (not counting music, which gets its own section). Media is vital to getting your game page into a presentable state for the public. A game page without any media just looks unfinished. A well-rounded game page has plenty of images--moving and still.
