## How do I access my blog?

Did you know you have a blog? Well you do, and it's accessible from your dashboard. Your developer blog is an excellent tool to keep fans and followers engaged, and to convert new ones. Post about gaming, game dev, or life in general; it's your blog. Remember that if you're posting news about a specific game, go to the management panel for that game and make a news post.
