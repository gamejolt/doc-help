## How do I make a game?

How do you make a game, you ask? First, you have to have the passion burning inside you. You have to want to eat, drink, sleep, and bathe in indie games... Nah, just kidding. We can't teach you how to make games (not until Game Jolt University is established), but it's pretty easy to teach yourself how to do it. A lot of indie game developers taught themselves how to do things like designing, coding, making graphics, and creating sounds.

What we can do is point you in the direction of a couple of excellent resources that will get you started. If you're an absolute beginner, or even if you've already started making games but could use some further instruction, either of the following sites is a great jumping-off point:
