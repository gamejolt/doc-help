## How do I make a news post?

News updates trigger follower notifications and are an essential part of publicizing your game. To create a news post for a particular game, go to your [developer dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/) and select the game from under "Your Games". On the game's management page, visit the "News" tab and click "Add Game News".

Here, you can give your post a title and write the post's content. News posts are written in Markdown, which is easy to use and allows you to do a number of cool things without having to write in HTML. For help with  Markdown, consult our [Markdown guide](http://help.gamejolt.com/markdown-games).

Be sure to space out your news updates. Because we want to offer a range of game news, multiple posts made in a brief period of time for the same game will not appear on the home page.
